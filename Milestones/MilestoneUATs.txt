The group will test multiple aspects of Homework Underground
The list is going to be:
	1. The Register and Login page and their connection with the database
	2. The Forum and the abilities that both posters and viewers can do
	3. Admin abilities 
	4. Proper connections between php files and http files
	5. uniform graphics and header on all of the pages
All the tests will be using PHPUnit and other programs to expedite the testing

1. This will be by testing the web/*.php files and their ability to move items to and from the database
	This will be tested by verifying all the entries into the database and the limits of *.php file

2. The forum will be populated and will be tested in order to verify that the user will be able to enter posts that s/he wishes to enter
	We will test whether or not the php files can withstand the height of posts during finals

3. The administrator should be able to remove any posts, and verifying that the adminstrator will be allowed those abilities will help the testing

4. confirm the connection between the two parts of the application

5. make sure that all pages call the header
